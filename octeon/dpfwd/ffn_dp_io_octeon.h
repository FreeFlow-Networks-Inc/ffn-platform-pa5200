 * ffn_dp_io_octeon.h -- OCTEON-II hardware packet-I/O backend (IPD/PIP + POW + PKO).
 *
 * NAMING: the shorthand is "PKI/PKO". On OCTEON-III (cn78xx) the input block
 * really is PKI + SSO; on the OCTEON-II parts in a PA-5220 it is IPD/PIP (input)
 * + POW (work scheduling) + PKO (output). This backend targets OCTEON-II and
 * uses those names; the structure is identical for PKI/SSO/PKO3.
 *
 * LICENSING / WHAT FFN SHIPS
 * -------------------------
 * The CVMX headers and libraries are Cavium/Marvell OCTEON SDK property. FFN
 * ships THIS SOURCE ONLY -- our own code calling a documented hardware API. It
 * compiles against an SDK the operator supplies on their own box for their own
 * hardware, gated behind -DFFN_HAVE_CVMX. Without the SDK the file still builds
 * and links, reporting the backend as unavailable, so the dataplane keeps
 * working on the AF_PACKET path. No SDK-derived binary ever ships with FFN.
 *
 * BUFFER OWNERSHIP (the property that matters most)
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * A work-queue entry covers two things that may or may not be one allocation:
 * the WQE and the packet data. Each must be released EXACTLY ONCE or the box
 * leaks FPA buffers and wedges within minutes. Rules enforced:
 *   * on transmit, PKO takes ownership of the packet data and frees it after the
 *     wire, so we must NOT free the data -- only the WQE;
 *   * on drop, we free both, data first (the WQE is still needed to find it);
 *   * a send failure leaves ownership with us, so we free both;
 *   * every WQE records its disposition, and a second disposal is a no-op that
 *     increments a bug counter instead of double-freeing.
 * The mock hardware in the test harness asserts exactly this.
 *
 * The OCTEON-III twist: PKI often places the WQE INSIDE the first packet
 * buffer, in which case the two are one allocation and releasing the data has
 * already released the WQE. `wqe_separate` below records which case this packet
 * is, captured on receive -- because by the time the answer is needed, on the
 * forward path, PKO3 may already have freed and recycled that buffer, so asking
 * the WQE then is a use-after-free. Freeing the WQE must therefore never
 * dereference it; the address and the aura are enough.
